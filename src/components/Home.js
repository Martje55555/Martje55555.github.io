                <p><center><u>Student Work Study 8/2018 - 6/2020</u></center>
                <center>I was in charge of monitoring a building that contained practice
                rooms and a computer lab for music majors to use. I made
                sure everyone complied with the building and computer lab rules.
                I also worked in an office setting answering phone calls, delivering mail
                and working with excel.

                <h3 className="ui centered header"><u>HACKATHONS</u></h3>
                <p><center><u>Google KickStart Round F 2020</u></center>
                <center>Participated in a global online coding competition, consisting 
                    of three-hour rounds of a variety of algorithmic challenges designed by 
                    google engineers.This was my first hackathon that I attended. It was a fun 
                    experience, I wasn't very successful in the competition, but the important 
                    thing was that I had fun with the challenge and learned from the experience.

                <p><center><u>HackTX 2020</u></center>
                <center>Worked on a project with a team which won 2nd place, where we 
                    created a solution to support low income or displaced families on 
                    finding and securing housing or other vital resources. Created an 
                    app using flutter/dart and the google map api that gathers nearby 
                    resources based on userâ€™s location and preference.The hackathon was a 
                    lot of fun as I attended with two of my friends that I work well with, 
                    which made things easier and smoother. The hackathon ran for over 36 hours, 
                    and I did not sleep during the whole duration. The sleepless nights were worth 
                    it as we ended up taking 2nd place in the HackTx Wayfair: Hack for Housing Inequality
                     challenge!
