                    Coordinated with a team of three to develop a mobile application that shows the distance and time difference
                    between two celestian bodies (e.q., planet, star), as part of the HackTx 2021 competition. Designed user interface logic for multi-screen mobile application, functions to calculate desired
                    variables, and performed code reviews.
                    Developed using Flutter, Dart, and Auth0.

                    Over the span of a weekend, I had the privilege to participate in the Code for Good Hackathon
                    hosted by JPMorgan Chase & Co. where we were given the opportunity to aid one of three nonprofit organization
                    through our development. My team and I worked with Femergy Ohio, an organization that focuses on the empowerment of
                    young girls and women, to find a solution to their difficulty in keeping young girls intrigued in a distance platform due to the
                    recent pandemic. My team and I developed a platform to serve as a safe space for the young girls to express themselves via journal entries
                    while also providing the mentors the resource to maintain updated with their mentees. Our project focuses on a personalized connection between the mentor
                    and the mentee to form an everlasting connection.

                    Worked on a project with a team which won 2nd place, where we
                    created a solution to support low income or displaced families on
                    finding and securing housing or other vital resources. Created an
                    app using flutter/dart and the google map api that gathers nearby
                    resources based on userâ€™s location and preference.The hackathon was a
                    lot of fun as I attended with two of my friends that I work well with,
                    which made things easier and smoother. The hackathon ran for over 36 hours,
                    and I did not sleep during the whole duration. The sleepless nights were worth
                    it as we ended up taking 2nd place in the HackTx Wayfair: Hack for Housing Inequality
                    challenge!
