                <center><p>
                    Worked on a project with a team which won 2nd place, where we
                    created a solution to support low income or displaced families on
                    finding and securing housing or other vital resources. Created an
                    app using flutter/dart and the google map api that gathers nearby
                    resources based on userâ€™s location and preference.The hackathon was a
                    lot of fun as I attended with two of my friends that I work well with,
                    which made things easier and smoother. The hackathon ran for over 36 hours,
                    and I did not sleep during the whole duration. The sleepless nights were worth
                    it as we ended up taking 2nd place in the HackTx Wayfair: Hack for Housing Inequality
                    challenge!
